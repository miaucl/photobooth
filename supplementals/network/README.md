# Network

Network options for the photobooth.

## Router

Several possibilities are available to access the photobooth. It can either be connected to a regular router, by which it has access to all printers on that network and the photobooth web page can be accessed by other devices.

## Printer Hotspot

Most network printers provide a mode to provide their own hotspot. This is useful, when one does not have access to a network or for a mobile setup. The photobooth can use the printer directly and other devices will be able to reach the photobooth web page by connecting to the printers hotspot.

## ESP32/ESP8266 Hotspot (or similar)

When no printer is needed, a simple low-cost hotspot can be created by a ESP32/ESP8266 chip, which creates a network over which other devices can access the photobooth web page.

Alternatively, a phone or tablet does the job as well.
