# Todo's

List of things left to do.

## Quick setting for single or 2x2 picture

Option to disable/enable it and provide values for common cases "single", "2x2"

## Fix reduced picamera2 for more powerful RPIs

For the zero, the image to display has to be smaller than the photo max size and is reduced in code, make a `picamera2_zero` adaptation

## Update the photo webpage

- Cleaner design
- Add a random page

## Add ads to show

- Add a list of files to the config to show ads in between photos in the idle time and make it configurable

## Add flash (white screen) when the photo is "taken"

- It is unclear sometimes when exactly the photo is taken

## Bugs
